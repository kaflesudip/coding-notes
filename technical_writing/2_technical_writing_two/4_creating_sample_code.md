- correct
- concise
- quickly understand
- easy to reuse
- minimal side effect

# 1. Correct

Sample code should

- build without errors
- perform claimed task

- language-specific conventions

## 2. Explain how to run sample code

- install library
- adjust env. variable



## 3. Concise 

- short and include only necessary components

## 4. understandable

- descriptive class and variable names
- avoid hard-to-decipher programming tricks
- avoid deeply nested code
- use bold or colored font for attention
