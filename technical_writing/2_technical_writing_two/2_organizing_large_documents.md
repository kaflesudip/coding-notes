# Organizing large documents

Tactics:

- Choosing to write a single, large document or a set of documents
- Organizing a document
- Adding navigation
- Disclosing information progressively



## 1 When to write large

Some users may prefer shorter ones while some like longer. 

Should you write long documents?

- **Shorter documents:** How to guide, indroductory overviews, conceptual guides
  - aimed at readers new to subject
  - quick and general overview of topic
- **Lengthier**: in-depth tutorial, best practices and command-line reference pages
  - readers have some experience
- **Either**: A great tutorial. But can be broken into smaller parts.

Remember:

- many long document not designed for single sitting
- users may scan or search for a command

## 2 Outline a document

- Use browser plugin to audit accessibility of web pages

- outline information relevant to reader.
- share outline with contributors before drafting

## 3 Introduce a document

- what it covers
- prior knowledge you expect readers to have
- what document doesn't cover

## 4 Add naviation

- introduction and summary section
- heading and subheading
- Table of contents
- linked to related resouces and in-depth info
- links to what to learn next



## 5 Prefer task based heading

- Bad

  - Running the carambola command
  - Initializing the Froobus framework

- Good

  ```
  ## Creating the site
  
  To create the site, you run the `carambola` command-line tool. The command
  displays a series of prompts to help you configure the site.

## 6 Disclose information progressively

- introduce concepts towards instructions that rely on them
- break large walls of text
- break up large series of steps
- start with simple examples and instructions
