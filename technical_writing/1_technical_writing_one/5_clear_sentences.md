# Clear sentences

> Comedy writers seek the funniest results, horror writers strive for the scariest, and technical writers aim for the clearest. In technical writing, clarity takes precedence over all other rules. This unit suggests a few ways to make your sentences beautifully clear.

## 1. Choose strong verbs

- Use: Precise, strong and specific verbs.
- Reduce:
  - forms of be: is, are, am, was, were, etc.
  - occur
  - happen

### Weak and Strong:
- Weak: The error **occurs** when clicking the Submit button.
- Strong: Clicking the Submit button **triggers** the error.
- Weak: This error message **happens** when...	
- Strong: The system **generates** this error message when...
- Weak: We **are** very careful to ensure...	
- Strong: We carefully **ensure**...


### Exercise

**Bad:** When a variable declaration doesn't have a datatype, a compiler error happens.
- **Good:** When a variable declaration doesn't **specify** a datatype, the compiler **generates** an error message.
- **Good:** If you declare a variable but don't **specify** a datatype, the compiler **generates** an error message.

**Bad:** Compiler errors occur when you leave off a semicolon at the end of a statement.
- **Good:** Compilers **issues** errors when you **omit** a semicolon at the end of a statement.
- **Good:** A missing semicolon at the end of a statement **triggers** compiler errors. 


## 2.Reduce there is/there are

- Most cases - simply remove there is / there are
- Removing there is replaces generic subject with better subject.
- Bad: There is a variable called met_trick that stores the current accuracy.
- Good: A variable named met_trick stores the current accuracy. 
- Good: The met_trick variable stores the current accuracy.


## 3. Minimize certain adjectives and adverbs 

- Adjectives and adverbs amazing in fiction / poetry.
- But loosely defined and subjective for technical readers.
- Worst: Technical documentation may look like marketing material.
- E.g. (Good adds accuracy and belivability: 
	- **Bad**: Setting this flag makes the application run **screamingly** fast.
	- **Good:** Setting this flag makes the application run **225-250%** faster.
