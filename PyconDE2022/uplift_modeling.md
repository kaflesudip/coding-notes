# Introduction to Uplift Modeling

- Dr. Juan Orduz from Wolt

- Estimate causal effects of a treatment (e.g. marketing campaign) to target customers that are likely to respond.

## Motivation

1. How can we optimally select customers treated by marketing incentives?



## Issues:

- Different types of customers
  - Who Come back due to vouchers
  - Never come back regardless
  - Were on a vacation and wouldn't need a vacation.
  - Temporaility paused activties expecting a voucher :D 
- How do we measure?
  - We cannot "send" and "not send" an incentive to same user
