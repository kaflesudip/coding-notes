# List and Tables.

## 1. Types of list

- Bulleted: When ordering isn't important
- Numbered: When ordering important
- Embedded (In sentence with comma): Best to avoid.

## 2. Keep list items parallel

- Effective vs Defective list: Effective are parallel, defective non-parallel.
- All items in parallel match along following parameters:
  - grammar
  - logical category
  - capitalization
  - punctuation

### Good:
  > - carrots
- potatoes
- cabbages

### Bad:

> - carrots
- potatoes
- The summer light obscures all memories of winter.


## 3. Start numbered list items with imperative verbs.

- Imperative verb: Command like **open**, **start**. 


## 4. Punctuate items appropriately

- Capitalization and punctuation: If sentence use them otherwise do not use.


## 5. Create useful tables.

- People's eyes zoom to tables.
- Guidelines:
  - Each column -> meaningful header
  - Avoid too much text in cell.
  - Parallelism in data of individual column. 


## 6. Introduce each list and table

- With sentence that tells readers what the list or table represents (context).
- Terminate with period.
