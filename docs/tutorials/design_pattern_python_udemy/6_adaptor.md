# 6 Adapter

## 1. Intro

- similar to power adapter
  - different voltage requirements
  - Plug type (Europe, UK, USA)
  - we cannot modify our gadgets
- Adapter is a contract which adopts existing interface X to conform to interface Y.
- **Create an API to adapt to other API**

- **First of Structural Pattern**



## 2. Adapter (no caching)

- e.g. `LineToPointAdapter` - generate points from Line.
- Square to Rectangle Adapter.



## 3. Adapter (Caching)

- Cache to reduce generations.



## Summary

- How to implement
  - Determine API you have and API you need to Adapt
  - Create a component which aggregates the adapter
