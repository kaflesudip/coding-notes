# Short sentences
[https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/short-sentences](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/short-sentences)

## 1. Code and writing.

Minimize lines of code due as shorter code:

- Easier to read
- Easier to maintain
- extra lines of code -> additional points of failure

Same rules for technical writing. Shorter documentation:

- Faster to read
- Easier to maintain
- Extra lines -> Additional points of failure.


## 2. Focus each sentence on single idea

- Statement of program: Single task
- Sentence: Single idea.
- Bad:

> The late 1950s was a key era for programming languages because IBM introduced Fortran in 1957 and John McCarthy introduced Lisp the following year, which gave programmers both an iterative way of solving problems and a recursive way.

- Good:

> The late 1950s was a key era for programming languages. IBM introduced Fortran in 1957. John McCarthy invented Lisp the following year. Consequently, by the late 1950s, programmers could solve problems iteratively or recursively.


## 3. Convert some sentences to list:

- Or in sentence - consider bulleted list.
- Embedded list in sentence - List
- Bad:

> To alter the usual flow of a loop, you may use either a break statement (which hops you out of the current loop) or a continue statement (which skips past the remainder of the current iteration of the current loop).


- Good:

> To alter the usual flow of a loop, call one of the following statements:

> - break, which hops you out of the current loop.
- continue, which skips past the remainder of the current iteration of the current loop


## 4. Eliminate or reduce extraneous words:

- Textual junk, filters
- Bad: An input value greater than 100 *causes the triggering* of logging.
- Good: An input value greater than 100 *triggers* of logging.

- Words to change
- at this point in time -> now
- determine the location of	-> find
- is able to -> can

## 5. Reduce subordinate clauses

- Sentence: main clause and zero or more subordinate clauses
- Subordinate - modify idea of main clause.
- But less important.

> Python is an interpreted programming language, which was invented in 1991.

> - main clause: Python is an interpreted programming language
- subordinate clause: which was invented in 1991

Words to look:

- which
- that
- because
- whose
- until
- unless
- since

- Remember: Once sentence, one idea
- Do subordinate extence one idea or branch off to second?
- If divide, new sentence.


## 6. Distinguish that from which

- Which and that used differently in countries.
- In US.
-  which: nonessential subordinate clauses, pause while reading. Place comma
- That: an essential subordinate clause. No pause. No comma.


> Python is an interpreted language, which Guido van Rossum invented.

> Fortran is perfect for mathematical calculations that don't involve linear algebra.
