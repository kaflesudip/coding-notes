# Self-editing

- iterative process to final published document



## 1. Adopt a style guide

e.g. [https://developers.google.com/style](https://developers.google.com/style)] 

- Techniques from technical writing 1:
  - active voice
  - sequential steps as numbered lists
  - other lists as bullete
- Other techniques
  - Write in second person. Refer audience as "you" instead of "we"
  - place conditional clause before the statement. Not after.
  - format code-related text as code font

## 2 Think like your audience

- outline persona of audience
- review draft with the persona in mind
- **BUT** relying heavily on a persona (or two) can make it narrolwy focused
  - may not be useful to majority



## 3 Read it out lout

- Awkward phrasing, long sentences or anything that isn't natural
- alternatively, someone else can read
- See [https://developers.google.com/style/tone](https://developers.google.com/style/tone) 



## 4 Come back to it later

- an hour, two or three later
- read with fresh eyes



## 5 Change context

- Print it and read
- change font, color, size etc.



## 6 Find peer editor

- ask someone to review
