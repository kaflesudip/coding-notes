- Before telling bad news, is there anything you can try?

## 3. Software Entropy

- don't live with broken window.
- Technical debts

## 4. Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs

- Soldiers started with soup of stone but asked all ingredients eventually
- Farmers liked it.
- Same with stakeholders in Software development
- They will be happy with eventual result. So, ask gradually
- But remember how a boiled frog doesn't realize when temperature in increasing.
- Keep an eye on the big picture.

## 5. Good enough soup

- Great software today is preferable to perfect software tomorrow.
- Feature bloat:
  - more features than you need
