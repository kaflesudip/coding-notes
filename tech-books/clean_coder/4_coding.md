# 4. Coding

## 1. Preparedness

When you code you juggle between

1. Code must work
2. Code must solve problem
3. Code must fit into exisiting system
4. Coe must be redable.

### Different Bad codes

Avoid them:

1. 3 AM code
   1. May feel good working long hours
   2. But bite us again
   3. Utilize 8 hours in best way
2. Worry code
   1. Code written after big fight

### The flow zone

- What you feel
  - Hyper productive zone
  - You write more code
- **BUT this is not where you want to be**
- uncommunicative zone



### Music

- depends on person
- May or may not help write better code

### Interruptions

- Someone asks question when you are working
- Rude response? or other solution
  - Pariging with other while coding
  - TDD may help



## 2. Writer's block

- You do things to avoid code
  - Email
  - Documents
  - Books
  - Schedules
- But code doesn't appear
- **Solution:**Pair parter. Ohters discussed below:



### Creative input

- Spend away from useual problem
- Science fiction
- Mystey books
- See what works: TV may not work, movie may work.



## 3. Debugging

- May take days to find errors, bugs, vulnerabilities

### Debugging time

- is as expensive as coding time
- TDD
  - Less bugs and less debugging time
- Software developers creating plenty bugs
  - Is activing unprofessionally

## 4. Pacing yourself

- Software developement is maration not sprint

### Know when to walk away

- Stuck in a problem. Can't go home
  - You are tired

- Update stakeholders, team members



### Hope

- Hope is a project killer
- Hope I get this done in 10 dyas
- Don't let anyone else have hope

### Rushing

- Rushing doens't make code faster

### Overtime

- Don't overtime unless
  - your boss has full back plan if overtime fails
  - it's short time ( < 2 weeks)
  - You can afford

### False delivery

- to delivery, we rationalize
  - A new definition of "Done"
- Very unprofessional behavior

### Define "Done"

- When business analysts / testers
  - have created automated acceptance tests.

## 5. Help

- Help other
- Not because you are smarter
- Just fresh perspective

### Being helped

- When someone offers helps
  - Accept it
- Learn to ask for help
  - unprofessional to remain stuck
- Collaboration is criticial to effective programming

### Mentoring

- Progressional duty:
  - Senior programmer spend time mentoring juniors
