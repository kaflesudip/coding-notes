# 7. Acceptance testing



## 1. Communicating requirements

- Example of working with manager coding
- Discovered his and my vision are different



### Premature precision

- Business
  - Want to know what they will get exactly
- Developers
  - Want to know exactly what they are supposed to deliver
- Both cannot be acihieved



### The uncertainty principle

- When delivered,
  - It gives new info to people
  - new expecations
- More precise your requirements... less relevant they become
  - When system is implemented

### Estimation anxiety

- Accurate estimate is not possible
- Estimates are **Estimates**
- So, include error bars

### Late ambiguity

- Can mean different to business and programmers
- Professional's responsibility
  - Remove ambiguity from requirements



## 2. Acceptance tests

- Professionals drive definition all the way to acceptace tests



### Communication

- Purpose of acceptance tests
  - Communication
  - Clarity
  - precision

### who writes acceptance tests and when?

- Business analysts write
  - Happy path version
- QA writes unhappy path
- When?
  - Late precision - so, as let as possible
  - First day of iteration, mid point and ,,,

### The developes role

- Dev's job to connnect acceptance test to system
- Make tests pass



### Acceptance and unit test

- Witten by business for business
