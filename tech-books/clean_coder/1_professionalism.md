# Professionalism

## 1. Be careful what you ask for

- Non-professional: says stuff happens and writes next modules
- Professional: Takes responsiility



## 2. Taking responsibility

- May have disaster if Shipping without proper testing
- Should say product isn't ready to be shipped
  - Even if manager is upset prevents a possible disaster.
